🔐 Lab 3 Summary – Cryptographic Tools

This lab focuses on understanding and using cryptographic tools to secure data through encryption, hashing, and key management. You’ll explore:

| Component             | What You Do                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Symmetric Encryption  | Use tools like OpenSSL or gpg to encrypt/decrypt files using a shared key. |
| Asymmetric Encryption | Generate public/private key pairs and encrypt/decrypt messages with them.  |
| Hashing               | Use algorithms like SHA-256 to hash files and verify integrity.            |
| Digital Signatures    | Sign and verify messages using private/public key to ensure authenticity.  |
| Key Management        | Generate, export, and import keys using tools like GPG.                    |

💡 Goal:
To understand how cryptographic functions work in real tools and how they protect data in the real world.
